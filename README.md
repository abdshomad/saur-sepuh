![Saur Sepuh Game](https://picsum.photos/seed/madangkara-banner/1200/400)

**Saur Sepuh: Legenda Madangkara** is a web-based, real-time strategy (RTS) game simulator inspired by the legendary Indonesian radio drama, "Saur Sepuh". Step into the role of Prabu Brama Kumbara, build the mighty kingdom of Madangkara, manage resources, train warriors, and face dynamic challenges powered by a generative AI.

This project showcases a modern, frontend-only application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, demonstrating core RTS mechanics in a rich, culturally-themed setting.

## ✨ Core Features

-   **City Building & Management**: Construct and upgrade various buildings like the `Istana` (Keep), `Sawah` (Farms), and `Barak Prajurit` (Barracks).
-   **Real-time Resource Generation**: Passively generate `Pangan` (Food), `Kayu` (Wood), `Batu` (Stone), and `Bijih Besi` (Ore).
-   **PvE Combat System**: Engage in simplified player-versus-environment combat against mythical creatures from Indonesian folklore like the `Celeng Raksasa` (Giant Boar) and `Garuda`.
-   **Dynamic AI-Powered Events**: Experience random in-game events generated by a generative AI, presenting you with choices that have real consequences for your kingdom's resources.
-   **Technology Tree (Visual Placeholder)**: A foundation for a research system to unlock new abilities and upgrades.
-   **Real-time Game Loop**: All resource generation, building upgrades, and timers run in real-time, updating every second.
-   **Responsive UI**: The interface is designed with Tailwind CSS to be accessible and functional across desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) 19 (using `importmap`, no build step)
-   **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
-   **AI Integration**: Generative AI for dynamic event generation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is configured to run directly in the browser without any build steps.

### Prerequisites

-   A modern web browser that supports ES modules (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
-   An API key for the generative AI service being used.

### Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    The application is designed to use an API key from `process.env.API_KEY`. For local development without a build tool, you need to manually set this key:
    -   Open the `services/geminiService.ts` file.
    -   Replace `process.env.API_KEY` with your actual AI API key string:
        ```typescript
        // In services/geminiService.ts
        const API_KEY = "YOUR_AI_API_KEY_HERE"; 
        ```
    > **Note:** For a production environment, you should use a backend proxy or a build tool like Vite/Next.js to properly manage environment variables and protect your API key. Do not commit your API key directly to version control.

3.  **Launch a Local Server:**
    While you can open `index.html` directly, it's highly recommended to use a simple local server to avoid potential issues with file paths or browser security policies.
    -   If you have Python installed:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
    -   If you have Node.js installed, you can use `serve`:
        ```bash
        npx serve .
        ```
    -   Alternatively, use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.

4.  **Open the game:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your local server) in your web browser.

## ⚔️ Gameplay Mechanics

The core gameplay loop revolves around a continuous cycle of development and strategy:
1.  **Build & Upgrade**: Start with a basic `Istana`. Upgrade it to unlock new buildings and features. Construct resource buildings (`Sawah`, `Penggergajian`, etc.) to fuel your economy.
2.  **Manage Resources**: Keep an eye on your resource levels in the header. Use them wisely to upgrade buildings, train troops (feature to be expanded), and conduct research.
3.  **Engage in Combat**: Test your might by attacking monsters on the world map. A simple but effective combat system calculates battle outcomes based on army power and troop counters.
4.  **React to Events**: Be prepared for unexpected events! A trade caravan might arrive with a lucrative offer, or a sudden drought could threaten your food supply. Your choices matter.
