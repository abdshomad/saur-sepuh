### Feature Details

#### CG-101: Kingdom Building & Upgrading
-   **Description:** Players can construct and upgrade a variety of buildings within their kingdom. Each upgrade costs resources and takes a specific amount of real time, managed by a global timer system. The UI provides modals for upgrade confirmation and shows active timers on building cards.

#### CG-102: Real-Time Resource Generation
-   **Description:** The game features four primary resources (Pangan, Kayu, Batu, Bijih Besi) that are generated passively in real-time. Production rates are tied to the level of corresponding resource buildings (Sawah, Penggergajian, etc.).

#### CG-103: PvE Combat System
-   **Description:** A dedicated "Pertempuran" view allows players to engage in Player-vs-Environment combat against a predefined list of monsters. The combat resolution is based on total army power, with a simplified troop counter system providing strategic bonuses. Battle reports are shown to the player detailing victory/defeat, losses, and rewards.

#### CG-104: Real-Time Game Loop
-   **Description:** A central game loop updates the game state every second. This loop is responsible for incrementing resources, decrementing timers, and processing the completion of upgrades.

#### CG-105: Functional Research System
-   **Description:** Players can research technologies from a technology tree in the `Perguruan`. Each technology provides a permanent bonus to the player's economy or military (e.g., increased resource production, troop stat boosts). Research costs resources, takes real time, and supports dependencies between technologies.

#### CG-106: Troop Training System
-   **Description:** Players can train different types of troops from their military buildings (e.g., `Barak Prajurit`, `Lapangan Panah`). The training process costs resources and takes real time, managed by a dedicated training queue per building. A modal interface allows players to select the quantity of troops to train.

### Feature Details

#### AI-101: Dynamic AI-Powered Events
-   **Description:** The game periodically triggers random events using a generative AI. These events present the player with a narrative scenario and two choices, each with distinct resource consequences. The system uses a predefined JSON schema to ensure the AI's response is structured and can be directly integrated into the game state.
