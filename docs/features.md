### Feature Details

#### CG-101: City Building & Upgrading
-   **Description:** Players can construct and upgrade a variety of buildings within their city. Each upgrade costs resources and takes a specific amount of real time, managed by a global timer system. The UI provides modals for upgrade confirmation and shows active timers on building cards.

#### CG-102: Real-Time Resource Generation
-   **Description:** The game features four primary resources (Pangan, Kayu, Batu, Bijih Besi) that are generated passively in real-time. Production rates are tied to the level of corresponding resource buildings (Sawah, Penggergajian, etc.).

#### CG-103: PvE Combat System
-   **Description:** A dedicated "Pertempuran" view allows players to engage in Player-vs-Environment combat against a predefined list of monsters. The combat resolution is based on total army power, with a simplified troop counter system providing strategic bonuses. Battle reports are shown to the player detailing victory/defeat, losses, and rewards.

#### CG-104: Real-Time Game Loop
-   **Description:** A central game loop updates the game state every second. This loop is responsible for incrementing resources, decrementing timers, and processing the completion of upgrades.

### Feature Details

#### AI-101: Dynamic AI-Powered Events
-   **Description:** The game periodically triggers random events using a generative AI.

The system uses a predefined JSON schema to ensure the AI's response is structured and can be directly integrated into the game state.
